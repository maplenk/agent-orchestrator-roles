-- bug as documented in queries/changelog.sql: trailing string literals (and
-- placeholders) on the RHS of `=` in a DELETE get silently stripped, so the
-- generated SQL ends up mid-clause and the row count is meaningless. The
-- store runs that DELETE directly via tx.ExecContext inside
-- Store.DeleteSession, inside the same transaction as the SessionIsSeed
-- probe and the raw change_log cleanup.

-- NOTE: the two conditional pause_json writes (set-if-absent, clear-if-incident)
-- are deliberately NOT sqlc queries — same sqlc 1.31 SQLite-parser bug as the
-- DELETE above. Literals on the RHS of `=` (`pause_json = ''`, `is_terminated =
-- 0`) get silently stripped, and the truncated tail leaks into the NEXT
-- generated const. The store runs both directly via ExecContext; see
-- SetSessionPauseIfAbsent / ClearSessionPauseIfIncident in session_store.go.
